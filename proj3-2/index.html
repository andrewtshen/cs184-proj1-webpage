            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            At max ray depth 0, only the light source can be seen. Increasing max ray depth to 1, the floor, 
            walls, and outline of the spheres appear. Increasing to 2, the ceiling appears and the left sphere
            shows a reflection of the scene. Increasing to 3, the right sphere refracts the walls. Increasing to 4,
            the reflection of the right sphere in the left sphere is updated to have color, while the right sphere 
            refracts more light from different directions. With max ray depth 5 and 100,
            everything in the scene becomes brighter.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>
            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            Certain features of the scene will only appear with an increased number of bounces. For example, with max ray depth 0,
            the scene is entirely black aside from the light source because the rays don't bounce off anything, therefore not 
            revealing anything in the scene. Furthermore, rays responsible for the reflections and refractions seen in the
            spheres require more bounces to actually reach the spheres and have an effect on their appearance. The same can 
            be said about their shadows. As a result, more features appear as we increase the maximum number of ray bounces.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2. Microfacet Material</h3>
        <p><b>
            Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene `CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae` rendered with $\alpha$ set to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that, to change the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for `microfacet`.

            Show two images of scene `CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae` rendered using cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance sampling. The sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Briefly discuss their difference.
