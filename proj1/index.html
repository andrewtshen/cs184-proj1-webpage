<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>During this project we implement methods to efficiently and cleanly render an image in a process called rasterization. Using Barycentric coordinates, we were able to implement texture mapping so that we could apply textures to rasterized triangles. In addition, we also implemented transformations that allowed us to translate, scale, and rotate the image. We found it very interesting to go through the entire pipeline of processing and displaying an image. The rasterization process taught us a lot about the importance of paying close attention to small details in the algorithms. Though they might appear simple and easy to comprehend, small error such as off by one errors can have a drastic impact on the outcome of the renders. For example in some cases, failing to clip values to the right bounds resulted in outlines of triangles appearing and other unexpected artifacts. In all, this project gave us valuable insight to the basics of rasterization -- allowing us to take a peek under the hood of a complex process.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>In order to rasterize triangles, we first find the bounds by computing the min and max of the x and y coordinates for each vertex of the triangle. This enables us to narrow down our search significantly for potential points within this triangle. Then, we iterated through each possible point within that bounding box and performed the point-in-triangle test (as shown in the picture below) to determine if the point was in the triangle. If it was determined to be in the triangle, then that pixel would then be colored with its respective color. As a slight naunce, depending on the order of the point, the inside check may potentially fail and actually give the region outside the triangle. To correct for this, we can add an additional conditional that flips the inequality to make the triangle representation order agnositc. Finally, this algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample in the bounding box as our algorithm goes through each pixel in the bounding box exactly once.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
<p>
	The supersampling algorithm we implemented works as follows. We will use the sample bounding box as we did in Task 1. For each pixel in the bounding box, we then compute the location of each of the subsamples within that box and iterate through each of those subsamples. From here, we perform the same algorithm in Task 1 to compute whether or not the subsample is within the triangle and store it in the proper place in the sample_buffer data structure (which we will go into later on in this paragraph). Then in the resolve_to_framebuffer function, we use the sample_buffer in order to take the average of the subsamples that correspond to a given pixel to compute its value. Diving deeper into the sample_buffer, we effectively use it to store a grid of all of the subsamples with the same index method as in the original pixel screen. Because the sample_buffer depends on the number of subsamples, we must reallocate the sample_buffer each time that we change the sample_size. 
</p>
<p>
	Although supersampling is more inefficient as it scales based on the sample_size, it is very helpful in antialiasing and creating smoother edges as we first adjust our sampling to a higher frequency to capture the high frequency signals in our image and then smooth over those higher frequencies by averaging subsamples together. This is most apparent in the examples displayed below in which there is a clear artifact from aliasing in the 1 sample/pixel, which is then smoothed over in the 16 samples/pixel and the true nature of the triangle is revealed.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<p>Barycentric coordinates are coordinates that are used to specify the location of a point relative
  to some kind of shape, like a triangle. Because a triangle has three sides, the position of a 
  point inside the triangle can be described using three corresponding barycentric coordinates, whose values 
  sum to one and are dependent on the point's distance from each side. In the image below, 
  each side of a triangle has a different respective color. Furthermore, the color of a point within 
  the triangle can be calculated using barycentric coordinates, which essentially determine a color
  using proportions of the point's distance from each side.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p> Pixel sampling is mapping the values or colors from some texture onto the screen.
  In order to implement texture mapping, we calculated the barycentric coordinates of each sample within the triangle
  in screen space. Then, we calculated the position of the corresponding point in texture space using
  the same barycentric coordinates and the vertices of the texture space triangle. Once we had the corresponding point in texture space, we used either nearest or bilinear pixel sampling to map the color onto the screen. Nearest pixel sampling
  works by rounding the coordinates (x, y) to the nearest pixel. On the other hand, bilinear pixel sampling
  finds and utilizes the nearest four pixels relative to (x, y). It computes a weighted sum on those four pixels by 
  performing two instances of linear interpolation. In the images below, you can see that bilinear sampling does a better job of blending the colors along the edges.
  There will be a more noticeable difference between the two methods when encountering high frequencies. Nearest pixel sampling will have sharper edges, whereas bilinear pixel sampling 
  will have edges that are more smoothed out because it computes color using four distinct pixels rather than one.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>
	Level sampling is performed using the mipmap in order to retrieve different resolutions of the same image. In this manner, we can apply textures of different resolutions to different parts of the image depending on how it is warped. This enables to maintain the similar amounts of accuracy and detail to regions that are not warped heavily by using higher resolutions levels of the mipmap. On the other hand, regions that are heavily warped still have the correct overarching texture as they use a lower resolution.	In order to determine which level of the mipmap to use, we first approximate the level by finding the distance to the nearest point and applying the log function. Then, we determine the correct level to use in two different ways. The first is to use the nearest level by rounding the approximate level. The second is to interpolate by taking a weighted average of the respective textures drawn from the two mipmap levels.
</p>

You can now adjust your sampling technique by selecting pixel sampling, level sampling, or the number of samples per pixel. Describe the tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three various techniques.
Using a png file you find yourself, show us four versions of the image, using the combinations of L_ZERO and P_NEAREST, L_ZERO and P_LINEAR, L_NEAREST and P_NEAREST, as well as L_NEAREST and P_LINEAR.
To use your own png, make a copy of one of the existing svg files in svg/texmap/ (or create your own modelled after one of the provided svg files). Then, near the top of the file, change the texture filename to point to your own png. From there, you can run ./draw and pass in that svg file to render it and then save a screenshot of your results.
Note: Choose a png that showcases the different sampling effects well. You may also want to zoom in/out, use the pixel inspector, etc. to demonstrate the differences.
