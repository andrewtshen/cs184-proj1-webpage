<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we implement methods to generate Bezier curves and surfaces, as well as methods to edit triangle meshes.
    Using de Casteljau's algorithm, we were able to evaluate Bezier curves given a set of control points. We later extended
    this implementation to work for 2D sets of control points, allowing us to generate Bezier surfaces. Afterwards, we implemented
    methods that would allow us to modify triangle meshes in order to give them a smoother and more satisfying appearance. This involved
    using vertex normals, flipping edges, splitting edges, and upsampling with loop subdivision. We found it very interesting to
    implement the calculations behind Bezier curves and surfaces, as well as the various techniques involved in working with
    triangle meshes. At first, meshes seemed complicated to work with, given the numerous variables associated with their elements.
    However, as we took more time to understand half-edges and the different data structures using them, we were able to gain
    a better understanding and intuition as to how meshes were represented and how to correctly modify them. During the process of
    implementing the modifications, we learned how important it was to use diagrams and visualizations, as the multiple variables involved
    could get convoluted very easily. Overall, this project gave us valuable insight to triangle meshes, how they work, and why they are 
    important to computer graphics.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  The de Casteljau's algorithm is a method to generate Bezier curves from a set of control points by using linear interpolation recursively. We implemented the linear interpolation step to reduce n control points down to n-1 control points, which is one level of the subdivision. If we start with N control points then we can reduce to a single control point on the Bezier curve by performing N-1 subdivisions.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces as it allows us to compute Bezier curves along the two different axes of a 2D set of control points. After computing Bezier curves along two axes we can identify the Bezier surfaces. To find a singular point on the Bezier surface given by coordinates (u, v), we first apply the de Casteljau algorithm to each row of the control points using u to get a vector of points. Then, we apply the de Casteljau algorithm once more using v to get a single point that is on the Bezier surface. By performing this algorithm on different values of (u, v), we can compute the Bezier surface.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by iterating through the faces in contact
    with the vertex. We started with the vertex's half-edge, then progressed onto its twin's next 
    half-edge, and so on until we reach the same half-edge that we started with. Each half-edge corresponds to a 
    different face, so for each face, we take its normal and add it to a running sum vector. After we iterate 
    through every face at the vertex, we return the average of the running sum vector, which we calculate by dividing the vector by
    the number of faces.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We set variables for each mesh element involved in the edge flip. More specifically, there are 10 half-edges, 5 edges, 
    4 vertices, and 2 faces. We set variables because we want to maintain access to the original elements after we modify 
    other ones. Following the diagram below, we visualized the flip as rotating the "inner" figure clockwise, and adjusted the pointers accordingly. We
    started by setting the neighbors for each half-edge. Then, we set the half-edges for each edge and vertex. The faces'
    half-edges are not changed by the flip.

    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    We didn't discover this bug until we got to Part 6, but initially, we did not update the outer half-edges along with
    the rest of the half-edges. We thought that the outer half-edges were unaffected by the flip, but after looking more
    closely at the diagram, we saw that their twin half-edge was changed.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We set variables for each mesh element involved in the edge flip similarly to the last question. More specifically, there are 16 half-edges, 7 edges, 5 vertices, and 4 faces in total. We used temporary variables similarly to Task 4 in order to hold intermediate values and also created 6 new half-edges, 3 new edges, 1 new vertex, and 2 new faces. In order to change as little as possible, we try to leave as many mesh objects in the same location only really changing around the assignments for the "inner" portion of the split. To implement everything, we first listed out all of the half-edges, edges, vertices, and faces so that we would not accidentally forget to update anything and tried to be as systematic as possible. Below is the diagram that we drew out in order to map out the mesh elements to the correct place.

    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    Thankfully we didn't experience too much of an eventful debugging journey. The only problems we encountered were one or two mistakes in the assignment of variables which we fixed by carefully double checking all of the values and making sure everything was consistent with the implementation and the diagram.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    First, we set all existing vertices and edges' isNew value to false. This ensures that we can check whether an edge or vertex was part of the original mesh. Next, we computed the new positions for all existing
    vertices according to the loop subdivision rule. This involved checking the degree of the vertex and also the positions
    of its neighboring vertices. Then, we calculated the positions of the new vertices that would result from splitting edges.
    After that, we split every edge that is part of the original mesh and assign the new resulting vertex the position stored at that edge. 
    Next, we flip any new edges that connect an original vertex to a new vertex. Finally, we update the 
    original vertices with their new positions that we calculated near the start of this process, completing our loop subdivision. 
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    After loop subdivision, meshes become smoother. More specifically, sharp edges and corners are more rounded and curved, giving
    the mesh an overall less jagged appearance. 
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
