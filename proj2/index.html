<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
  The de Casteljau's algorithm is a method to generate Bezier curves from a set of control points by using linear interpolation recursively. We implemented the linear interpolation step to reduce n control points down to n-1 control points, which is one level of the subdivision. If we start with N control points then we can reduce to a single control point on the Bezier curve by performing N-1 subdivisions. 
</p>

<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces as it allows us to compute Bezier curves along the two different axes of a 2D set of control points. After computing Bezier curves along two axes we can identify the Bezier surfaces. To find a singular point on the Bezier surface given by coordinates (u, v), we first apply the de Casteljau algorithm to each row of the control points using u to get a vector of points. Then, we apply the de Casteljau algorithm once more using v to get a single point that is on the Bezier surface. By performing this algorithm on different values of (u, v), we can compute the Bezier surface.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by iterating through the faces in contact
    with the vertex. We started with the vertex's half-edge, then progressed onto its twin's next 
    half-edge, and so on until we reach the same half-edge that we started with. Each half-edge corresponds to a 
    different face, so for each face, we take its normal and add it to a running sum vector. After we iterate 
    through every face at the vertex, we return the average of the running sum vector, which we calculate by dividing the vector by
    the number of faces.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We set variables for each mesh element involved in the edge flip. More specifically, there are 10 half-edges, 5 edges, 
    4 vertices, and 2 faces. We set variables because we want to maintain access to the original elements after we modify 
    other ones. We visualized the flip as rotating the "inner" figure clockwise, and adjusted the pointers accordingly. We
    started by setting the neighbors for each inner half-edge. The outer ones are not affected by the flip. Then, we set the
    half-edges for each edge, vertex, and face.
